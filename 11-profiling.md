Installations steps

1. Install QT. QT can installed using the command  apt-get install qt4-dev-tools libqt4-dev libqt4-core libqt4-gui.
2. Install cube4

Each individual installation above will have its own depdendencies. For exammple cube4 will have a dependency for zlib and that will have to be installed first before we install cube4.
